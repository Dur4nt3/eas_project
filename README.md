# Etch-a-Sketch Project

### Etch-a-Sketch Project | The Odin Project | Foundations

This is the second java script project within "The Odin Project".

After introducing additional JavaScript concepts, the main goal of this project is to put said concepts into practice.

**Skills demonstrated: Basic HTML, basic CSS, basic JavaScript**

**Webpage responsiveness: THIS PROJECT WILL NOT DISPLAY PROPERLY ON A MOBILE PHONE.**

### **Note:**

Because the drawing mechanic utilizes the "mouseenter" event, you will need to use "Right-Click" in order to navigate the drawing board without actually "drawing".
